# student_health_risk_analytics
About this Project:
This project explores the intersection of academic pressure and physciological health.  The core objective is to conduct a Comparative Bias Audit between two discint data sources:

1. Primary Dataset (Synthetic): A simulated model of 1.000 college students tracking heart rate, blood pressure and            self-reported stress levels. 
2. Benchmark Dataset (Real-World): High-fidelity stress and well-being data sourced from MIT research.

The Problem:
Synthetic data is a powerful tool used for training machine learning models, but it often lacks the messy nuances of human biology and variability.  If these models are biased, particularly regarding gender or physiological reporting, they can lead to inaccurate health risk assessments.
